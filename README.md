### MAP : Materials by Applications & Positions

Long time ago , I learned about Google workspace and all of its applications. To accomplish my task, I read the mighty help centers for each application : Gmail, Drive, Calendar …

Although there is a learning center for Google Workspace, it does not gather the skills explained and told in the other help centers.

So, when it came to pass onto my knowledge to my fellow companions, many links were given.

Some find it difficult to retrieve information afterwards among those many urls and help centers.

In the meantime,  a powerful tool was emerging : Appsheet

This was the moment I decided to create one tool to rule…gather them all !	


> MAP : Materials by Applications & Positions

`#ffffff An Appsheet application with the skills retrieved with Apps Script code from all the help center in different languages.`
