# MAP : Materials by Applications & Positions

Long time ago , I learned about Google workspace and all of its applications. To accomplish my task, I read the mighty help centers for each application : Gmail, Drive, Calendar …

Although there is a learning center for Google Workspace, it does not gather the skills explained and told in the other help centers.

So, when it came to pass onto my knowledge to my fellow companions, many links were given.

Some find it difficult to retrieve information afterwards among those many urls and help centers.

In the meantime,  a powerful tool was emerging : Appsheet

This was the moment I decided to create one tool to rule…gather them all !	


> MAP : Materials by Applications & Positions

[An Appsheet application with the skills retrieved with Apps Script code from all the help center in different languages.](#) 

## With this tool , you’ll have the power to  

* Include documentation about any subject you want , not just Google Workspace

* Have a dedicated training calendar to register to with an attendees limit managed by Appsheet

* Communicate by Chat or Gmail to send PDF newsletter

* Manage simply skills by products or jobs/positions to be able to search in the entire library with a general search functionality

* Algorithm managing all your custom resources documents from Drive and links from Google Workspace Application help centers in order to keep the document organized and updated

* No cost since Appsheet licence are now included in Google Workspace
